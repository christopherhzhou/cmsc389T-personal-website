        Hello! My name is Christopher Zhou. I'm an aspiring software developer, 
        looking to work on cutting-edge projects at companies building for a better
         future. In preparation for a  long and exciting career, I've spent the 
         last couple of years building and refining my skills as a programmer. 
         For starters, I'm now a junior at the University of Maryland, nearing 
         the final semester of my studies in computer science and statistics.
          Here I've had the great privilege of taking many courses covering a 
          wide spectrum of domains in computer science, ranging from advanced 
          algorithm analysis to machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
          Not only have these courses sparked my interest in these new and exciting 
          areas of research, these courses in aggregate have helped me become a
           more well-rounded programmer with a better understanding of how the 
           field of computer science continues to grow and evolve. I also had the 
           pleasure of interning at ServiceNow last summer in 2021, where I gained
            extensive experience working as a frontend web developer, building a 
            fully-featured JSON editor entirely in JavaScript and React. Because
             of the incredible experience I had, I plan to return there to intern 
             over the summer of 2022.

      </p>

      <p>
        As for things computer science related, I'm interested in machine learning 
        and artificial intelligence. Although the principles of ML are relatively 
        straightforward, it has been shown time and time again to be an extremely
         powerful tool and I want to see what I'm able to accomplish with it. Another
          closely related area that's been the focus of a lot of research lately 
          is natural language processing, which I'm also curious about. Although I 
          haven't yet taken a class in it, I'm interested in learning more about it
           and what kinds of possibilities it unlocks for our future.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for things outside my academic and professional life, I like to play 
        piano in my free time, dabbling both in classical and modern (anime, gaming, 
        pop) music. My current goal is to learn all of the Chopin Op. 10 etudes and
         upload a recording of each of the 12 compositions to YouTube. I've nearly
         finished learning 1 and 2, and am currently working on 12, arguably the
         most well known etude of the set. I've also 
         been dabbling in a bit of gamging music arranged for the piano, namely 
         from the Final Fantasy series which has an expansive "piano collection" 
         series of professionally arranged piano pieces. I also play as a pianist 
         in the Gaming Symphony Orchestra at UMD, where we play exclusively gaming 
         music, an artform that is highly underrated in comparison to other kinds of orchestral music.
